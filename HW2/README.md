## Homework 2


**View Controller 1 - Updating labels** 

For the first screen checking the age I created a function that takes in a Integer, runs it through a switch statement using ranges in most of the cases, and spits out a String

**View Controller 2 - Adding Numbers**

For this one I decided to just increment (or clear) a multiplier integer instead of storing the results of the previous addition.  I also thought it would be cool to see how many numbers you're adding together so everytime you hit "add" it generates a new string showing the full equation.  Again I put this all in its own function so there's not too much logic within the Button clicked action function.

**View Controller 3 - Is this number even?**

This was the simplest one.  Again, I put the logic into it's own function that returns a string.  I also thought it would be good to see the current number in the string as well
